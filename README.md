This is just a simple example how to handle native element in your unity application.
Build was made with AltTesterUnitySDK 2.0.1 so you either use Driver 2.0.1 or update the build.

Before running the test you will need to update the path to the application and other capabilities

To run the test just simply run `dotnet test`.
